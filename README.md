**Step 1**: Gathering Requirements; Functional and Non-Functional Requirements; FURPS; FURPS+; agile-iterative approach (we won't write it once and that's it, documents will be reviewed and changed).

**Step 2**: Understanding use cases; Identifying the actors; Identifying the scenarios; Diagramming use cases; Employing user stories. Moving "from the application must do this and that" to "how the user is going to do it using the app"; Using Abstraction for the actors who have the same role (for Example Requester, Approver can be used to group multiple actors of different types who will use the functionnality in the same way); Login is not a use case in itself, we will focus on the user goals from using the application that can be done in one encouter, Login can be a step in the use cases; Merging 2 organizations is not a use case we will focus on for example.
