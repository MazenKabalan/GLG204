# CNAM Attendance

## Quick Description

A Java web application that allows CNAM administration to create events such as classes, information meetings, presentations of projects etc. assign them to a Teacher, add students to these events and generate attendance reports.

The students, using a light mobile application, can see the classes and check-in using their mobile phones. The system will verify that students are in the correct location/radius defined for the event in order to accept the check-in. Students can also share their location.

The teacher will be able to view the students on a map while on their way to the class and can generate attendance reports at the end of every event.
