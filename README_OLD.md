**Step 1**: Gathering Requirements; Functional and Non-Functional Requirements; FURPS; FURPS+; agile-iterative approach (we won't write it once and that's it, documents will be reviewed and changed).

**Step 2**: Understanding use cases; Identifying the actors; Identifying the scenarios; Diagramming use cases; Employing user stories. Moving "from the application must do this and that" to "how the user is going to do it using the app"; Using Abstraction for the actors who have the same role (for Example Requester, Approver can be used to group multiple actors of different types who will use the functionnality in the same way); Login is not a use case in itself, we will focus on the user goals from using the application that can be done in one encouter, Login can be a step in the use cases; Merging 2 organizations is not a use case we will focus on for example.

**Step 3**: Modeling the application: create a conceptual model, identify the classes and the relationships between them, What are the responsibilities of each class.

**Step 4**: Creating classes: Class diagrams, Converting classes to code, exploring object lifetime, using static or shared members. We will focus on what the classes do. Not just listing them as dumb data structures by focusing on the attributes.(We will try to follow the SOLID and GRASP principles/guidelines).

**Step 5**: Creating sequence diagrams, working with advanced UML diagrams, using UML Tools. We can check which tools allow us to generate code through UML Diagrams. Here's a list we can search in: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unified_Modeling_Language_tools
